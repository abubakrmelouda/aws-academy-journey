## 🎯 3 Key Concepts Mastered

1. **Cloud Computing Models:** 
   - **IaaS (Infrastructure):** Complete control (EC2, S3) - like renting a blank apartment
   - **PaaS (Platform):** Managed platform (Elastic Beanstalk) - like renting a furnished apartment
   - **SaaS (Software):** Ready-to-use apps (Gmail) - like staying in a hotel

2. **Six Advantages of Cloud Computing:**
   - Trade Capex for Opex (no upfront costs)
   - Massive economies of scale (AWS bulk discounts)
   - Stop guessing capacity (scale on demand)
   - Increase speed & agility (deploy in minutes)
   - Stop managing data centers (focus on business)
