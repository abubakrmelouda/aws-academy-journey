   - **Cloud costs:** Transparent, usage-based pricing
   - **Case Study - Delaware North:** Saved $35M over 5 years, reduced 205 servers by 90%
   - **TCO Calculator:** Compare 3-year costs (On-prem: $167,422 vs AWS: $75,009)

3. **AWS Organizations & Billing Management:**
   - **AWS Organizations:** Tree structure (Root, OUs, and Member Accounts)
   - **Consolidated Billing:** Single bill for multiple accounts

-   Reviewed Learner Guide
-   Studied Delaware North case study ($35M savings)
-   **Achieved 70% on Knowledge Check**
-   Explored AWS Pricing Calculator functionality

##  Key Insights from Content

### **AWS Billing Dashboard Tools:**
- **Spend Summary:** Month-to-date, forecast, historical comparison
- **Cost Explorer:** Visualize costs by service, region, instance type
